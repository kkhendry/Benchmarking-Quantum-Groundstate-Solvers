### Benchmarking Quantum Algorithms to Find the Ground State Energy of Large Molecules

#### Abstract
Several methods for performing computational chemistry have been developed to leverage quantum computers and algorithms. In the NISQ (Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum) device era, several variational algorithms are being researched to find the solution from ground state energies of molecules. This project aims to investigate, benchmark and combine these algorithms across universal gate-controlled quantum devices and quantum annealer devices to make progress towards simulating large molecules.
